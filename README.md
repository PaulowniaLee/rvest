Codes for scrapping static site in R. <br/>
- house_price_survey.R works with a local real estate site in Chongqing, Wanzhou. After manually inputing conditions on website, I use this script to collect all results returned. These codes were written in mid-2023 to anecdotally observe the slump of Chinese property market, they also demonstrate that one can use quite elementary codes to obtain useful information. 
- Advanced_Static.R first shows some tips with static sites, including user agents, session, randomised delay for response, progress log, and various automation strategies. These tips make scrappers easier to monitor and less likely to cause trouble. Then, it uses these tips in scrapping Indeed HK site for job posting data.
- API.R palys with Brewery API and APIs of New York Times. Both are free resources for pratice. 
- Scrap_by_ajax.R is a proof-of-concept example for scrapping dynamic sites with rvest. While contents are generated by json scripts with requests, as long as such requests are not randomly generated, rvest can make these requests itself and the rest are the same with static sites.
