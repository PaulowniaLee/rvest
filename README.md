Codes for scrapping static site in R. <br/>
house_price_survey.R works with a local real estate site in Chongqing, Wanzhou. These codes demonstrate that one can use quite elementary codes to obtain useful information. <br/>
Advanced_Static.R first shows some tips with static sites, including user agents, session, randomised delay for response, progress log, and various automation strategies. These tips make scrappers easier to monitor and less likely to cause trouble. A case study of crapping Indeed HK site is included. <br/>
API.R palys with Brewery API and APIs of New York Times. Both are free resources for pratice. <br/>
Scrap_by_ajax.R is a proof-of-concept example for scrapping dynamic sites with rvest. While contents are generated by json scripts with requests, as long as such requests are not randomly generated, rvest can make these requests itself and the rest are the same with static sites. <br/>
